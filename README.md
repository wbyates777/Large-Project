# Large-Project
Example of a large(ish) project.

This code is used to simulate and optimise water distribution networks.
The optimiser uses a number of machine-learning algorithms. See for example 

Yates, W. B. and Keedwell, E. C. (2021). Offline learning with a selection hyper-heuristic: An application to water distribution network optimisation. Evolutionary Computation, 29(2):187â€“210.


The objective is to demonstrate recent non-trivial programming experience.
